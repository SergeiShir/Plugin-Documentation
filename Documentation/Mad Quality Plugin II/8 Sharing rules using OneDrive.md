# Sharing rules using OneDrive
To share rules with your team using OneDrive:
1. Add the rule file in the `c:\users\...\Documents\Mad Quality Plugin II` folder to OneDrive.
2. Share the folder with your team members

Each team member then needs to :
1.  Install and sign into OneDrive on their computer so that it syncs locally on their computer. This creates the local folder on their machine that they can use as a link.
2.   Open the folder on OneDrive in their web browser.
3.   Select, “Add shortcut to OneDrive” to sync the rules folder to their computer
4.   In Flare, open the **Mad Quality Plugin II** tab and then click **Add Rules from a link** and enter the local path to the rule file, for example: `c:\Users\ExampleUser\OneDrive\MadQualityRules\Rules.xlsx`
5.   Select OK.
